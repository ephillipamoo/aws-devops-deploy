### Summary:

* **AWS handles the Kubernetes control plane** (high availability, upgrades, scaling, patching).
* **You manage the infrastructure and workloads**, like worker nodes, VPC, IAM, and application deployments.
* **Optional AWS-managed services** (like Fargate or Managed Node Groups) reduce your operational burden.



## Troubleshooting EKS 

1. Cluster Health and Node Status:
-------------------------------------
AWS Management Console:
Check the EKS cluster status in the AWS console for overall health, errors, and events. 
kubectl get nodes:
List all nodes in the cluster and their status (Ready, NotReady, etc.). 
kubectl describe node <node_name>:
Get detailed information about a specific node, including its events and conditions. 
kubectl get events:
Retrieve a list of recent events related to the cluster or specific objects.
 
2. Networking Issues:
-----------------------
VPC Flow Logs:
Analyze VPC flow logs to identify any network-related problems, such as blocked traffic or unusual patterns.
Security Group Rules:
Verify that security groups allow the necessary traffic for the cluster to function properly, including inbound and outbound rules for the load balancer and node groups.
Network Policies:
If using network policies, ensure they are correctly configured and not blocking necessary traffic between pods. 

3. IAM and Permissions:
--------------------------
IAM Roles:
Check the IAM roles associated with the EKS cluster and its nodes, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to access other AWS resources. 
Security Group Rules:
Verify that security groups associated with the cluster and nodes allow the necessary traffic for communication with other AWS services. 

4. Resource Limits and Requests:
----------------------------------
Resource Limits:
Ensure that pod resource requests and limits are appropriately configured to avoid resource starvation or denial of service.
Pod Scheduling:
Review pod scheduling and affinity settings (taints, tolerations, node selectors) to ensure pods are being placed on the correct nodes. 

5. Other Troubleshooting Techniques:
---------------------------------------
AWS CLI: Use the AWS CLI to retrieve detailed information about the cluster, node groups, and other resources. 
CloudWatch: Monitor cluster performance metrics and logs in CloudWatch to identify trends and potential issues. 
kubectl logs <pod_name>: Examine the logs of pods to diagnose application-level problems. 
Check Add-ons: If using EKS add-ons like CloudWatch agent, verify their status and logs. 
DNS Issues: If encountering DNS issues, verify that the CoreDNS pods are running and that the DNS service is correctly configured.
